Description: (the description of the model)
	This packages contains two main functions: ParameterEstimation() and MethylCalculation().
	ParameterEstimation() is a function to estimated the parameters that represent the probabilities of three active DNA methylation change types during n cell cycle(s).
	MethylCalculation() is a function to calculate the ratio of each methylation class after n cell cycle(s).
